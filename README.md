The second screenshot shows the screen when all but one word is found and the last word is almost found. The highlighted tiles will spell out the string the player is forming and is cleared on finding the word.
If word is not found, the user can press the X button to revert the incorrect highlighted titles into black tiles and start the new string from scratch.
